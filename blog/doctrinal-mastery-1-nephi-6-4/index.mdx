This week as I was reading in the Book of Mormon, 1 Nephi 6:4 really stood out to me. I decided that I wanted to study it in-depth. For the past few days I have been reviewing this passage and trying to pick out as many principles from it as I possibly can. 

It reads: “For the fulness of mine intent is that I may persuade men to come unto the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and be saved.” 

First, it is important to note that his one verse seems to be Nephi’s thesis statement for the rest of his writings. The “fullness” of his “intent”, or his whole purpose, is to “persuade men to come unto… God… and be saved.” However, the result of his great desire ultimately lies within each one of us. Will we heed the call of Nephi? Will we turn unto God, the only one capable of granting us salvation and eternal life? 

The 1828 Webster’s Dictionary definition of “persuade” is “To influence by argument, advice, intreaty or expostulation, to draw or to incline the will to a determination by presenting motives to the mind.” What motives does Nephi present to the mind that would influence someone to come unto God? One such motive is that of being saved. But what does it mean to be saved? As 2 Nephi 25:23 suggests, to be saved is to be reconciled to God. It is to be redeemed from sin and from death through the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. If we truly want to come unto God, we will acknowledge our faults, recognize that God is merciful to His children, and we will “bring forth fruit meet for repentance” (Alma 12:15). We will turn away from our sins.
