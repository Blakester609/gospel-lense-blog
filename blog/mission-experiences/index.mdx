 Doctrine and Covenants 128 reads, “Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad.” Go forward and not backward. Rejoicing. Exceeding gladness. This is the attitude that we should have when we choose to become part of the great work of salvation. But why should we desire to play a role in the gathering of Israel in the first place? What are the blessings that we receive in our own lives as we help others come unto Christ? I pray that the Spirit will teach you as I share with you some of the lessons I learned as I served for 24 months as a full-time missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the California Santa Rosa and the Concepción Chile missions. 

#### As we help others come unto Christ, God will make more of us than we can ever become on our own. 

When I was out for about 18 months, I was assigned by my mission president to be a trainer. At first I felt completely inadequate and afraid. I would have full responsibility for the training of a new missionary, and would therefore set him on a course and help shape the attitude that he would have for the rest of his mission. However, my mission president reassured me that I would be a great trainer, and I received a priesthood blessing from my zone leader in which the Spirit confirmed to me that I was doing the right thing and that I was going to be ok. As I trained this Elder, I witnessed so many miracles. The Lord blessed my companion with courage and strength in the moments where he was about to give up. I saw the great impact that the words of my companion had on those we taught. 

Because of his great humility and faithfulness and trust in the Lord, the Spirit testified powerfully to those we taught of the truthfulness of our message. I really came to understood that the most important thing was not my knowledge of scripture or speaking ability, but the power of a simple testimony as I shared experiences in which the Lord had blessed my life. 

As I became a witness of a spiritual transformation both in those we taught and in the life of my companion, I was changed. I gained a personal witness and testimony of this quote by President Ezra Taft Benson: “Men and women who turn their lives over to God will discover that He can make a lot more out of their lives than they can. He will deepen their joys, expand their vision, quicken their minds, strengthen their muscles, lift their spirits, multiply their blessings, increase their opportunities, comfort their souls, raise up friends, and pour out peace.”


#### God has a perfect plan for each and every one of us, His imperfect children, with Jesus Christ at the center of that plan.

Before the world was created, God knew us and we accepted and chose to follow his plan. 

Knowing this gives us an immense sense of worth as we know that we are children of God and that we have an eternal purpose to fulfill.

Part of this life is experiencing opposition, and that is ok.

Over the course of my mission I really struggled with self-worth and wondering if I was doing good enough or if I was up to the task. I was frustrated with the fact that I was so frustrated and upset with myself and our work, because this is the mission- this is the time where we are supposed to rejoice in our labors and give praise to God. 
During my last transfer I was really upset because for almost an entire month we were hardly finding anyone to teach and we weren’t teaching many people who were progressing towards baptism. I was frustrated about this because this was second to last month on my mission- I thought I was supposed to be having great results and helping lots of new people meet with the missionaries, and that if I wasn’t doing so that it was somehow my fault. That somehow I wasn’t being obedient enough, or talking to enough people, or that I wasn’t dedicated enough. But I came to realize that even if that was the case, that that is not what is really important. The important thing is that I have a determination to do good and to invite others to come unto Christ. 

I realized that I can accept these setbacks as a normal part of life, and instead of constantly asking myself why this or that happened or didn’t, that I can take these challenges and decide to learn from them. I can move forward. 

A scriptural account that demonstrates this is when King Mosiah reads his people the records on the plates of Zeniff. These plates gave an account of the destruction of King Noah and his people as well as the subsequent bondage and liberation of the people of King Limhi. When King Mosiah read his people these records, they “were struck with wonder and amazement. For they knew not what to think; for when they beheld those that had been delivered out of bondage they were filled with exceedingly great joy. And again, when they thought of their brethren who had been slain by the Lamanites they were filled with sorrow, and even shed many tears of sorrow. And again, when they thought of the immediate goodness of God, and his power in delivering Alma and his brethren out of the hands of the Lamanites and of bondage, they did raise their voices and give thanks to God.” This people did not try to ignore or justify the things they learned about; rather they accepted the reality of all these things that their friends went through and learned from them. 

We can do the same thing in our own lives by putting the past behind us and moving forward in faith. We can choose to acknowledge and accept all the experiences we have, both joyous and miserable, calm and terrifying, whether caused by our own actions, by someone else or our circumstances, as normal and natural parts of life that come to us as a result of living in a fallen world. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying that we should willingly sin and call it a natural part of life and bound to happen, but what I am saying is that no matter how many times we fall, we can choose to put that behind us, get back up again and move forward. This is only possible through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. His earthly mission, atoning sacrifice and resurrection are central to God’s plan of salvation for His children.

The Second Edition of Preach My Gospel states that “We would be helpless without the Atonement of Jesus Christ because we cannot save ourselves from sin and death.” But, because of Jesus Christ and His Atonement, “As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive” (1 Cor. 15:22).

My testimony and relationship with Christ began to grow and deepen in a way I had never experienced before beginning on the morning of September 13, 2022. That morning my companion and I received a call from the assistants where they asked us if we could be in our church building in around half an hour to meet with President Hukdhs. My first reaction was that I didn’t know that I had done wrong. But then on our way over to the church building I remembered talking to my mom a couple days earlier where she mentioned that she hadn’t heard from my older brother Mark for a few days. In that moment I knew. When our mission president and his wife got to the church building, my mission president asked to meet with me privately. We went into another room and he asked me if I knew why he was there and I said yes. He then informed me that my older brother had passed away. 

Shortly afterwards my mind was penetrated with a whole array of questions seeking to answer the whys and hows. My mission president immediately put me in contact with a psychologist working for missionary health. As I met with her via Zoom and continued to study the scriptures, as well as struggle to get along with my companion, I really did come to understand the truth and the meaning behind a phrase in Preach My Gospel that I had read less than a week earlier: “All that is unfair about life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.” I came to understand that because of the resurrection of Christ, everyone who has ever lived upon the face of the earth will also be resurrected one day, having a perfect body of flesh and bone where “even a hair of the head shall not be lost.” I came to know that because of the infinite grace and mercy of Jesus Christ and due to the perfect foreknowledge of God, every human being who has lived or ever will live upon the face of this planet will receive ample opportunity to understand and accept the gospel of Jesus Christ in this life or the next, without regard to how many times they have previously rejected the truth. 

This means that not only can I have a perfect hope that I will see my brother again as an immortal, resurrected being after this life, but also that I can have the full confidence that he will be able to accept and live the gospel in the next life, even if he did not fully do so in this life. In fact, it is likely that he has already done so. I now have a radiant hope, an inner peace and a joy even in the midst of adversity that comes from knowing that Jesus Christ is the answer to all of life’s burdens, doubts, pain and problems. Indeed, we can be made alive and completely whole, both physically and spiritually because of Jesus Christ and His Atonement. As Isaiah wrote, “He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it” (Isaiah 25:8). 

One way that I knew that the Atonement of Jesus Christ was working in my life was seeing how God put me in the path of other people to help them and he put others in my path. He used others as instruments in His hands to answer my prayers and He used me as an instrument in His hands to answer theirs. 

In one of my areas my companion and I received a referral from a member that was for the son of an older woman who used to be in the ward and his wife. At first I really had some doubts as to whether these people were even going to talk to us, since they did not know that their friend had told us to go by their house. But the Spirit reassured me that everything would work out. 

My companion and I went over to their house and we knocked on their door. An older woman came out and talked to us, and at first it was clear that she was not interested. But then she asked us how we knew her name, and we provided the name of the member who had referred her to us. She agreed to another time where we could come by and the next time her husband and mother joined the lesson. She was shocked by this, because she said that for over 20 years her husband wanted nothing to do with the missionaries. 

It was amazing how the Lord prepared them to meet with us and how the Spirit touched their hearts. She and her husband were both baptized, along with her mother who was 93 years old. In the process of teaching them it became very clear to me that my companion and I were called of God to be the missionaries in this specific moment in time to teach these specific people. I believe that they did have a change of heart and there were a lot of factors that influenced them to listen to us. But I also like to think that we were the only missionaries who were capable of listening to and understanding them and helping them with their specific needs in that moment in time. It is almost as if it had been orchestrated by God even before the world began. 

One of the experiences I had where I knew that God had answered my prayers through others happened as I was leaving this same area. I was very upset because I felt like I hadn’t done enough in the area and because I really wanted to stay. The day before the transfer we went by the house of some members so that I could say goodbye. As this sister in the ward thanked me for my service in the ward, she told me “There are a lot of missionaries who at the end of their missions wonder if they have done enough. But the Lord is pleased with our efforts and with what we have done to serve Him.” This was such an amazing blessing because I had not even mentioned to her that I was struggling. And yet the Spirit inspired her with those words in the exact moment that I needed them. There were countless other experiences I had like this where it was as if the Lord was reaching out to me, telling me “You’ve got this. You are good enough. I see your efforts.” 

#### God has a work for us to do. Now is the time to become a part of it.

President Russell M. Nelson said “Now is the time we can learn. Now is the time we can repent. Now is the time we can bless others and ‘lift up the hands which hang down.’”  

I learned on the mission that the only thing I can control is what I do now, in this very moment. I now plead with you to do what you can now to invite others to come unto Christ and to participate in the gathering of Israel. If you are struggling or have strayed off the path that leads to eternal life, I invite you to come back. To choose to repent. I saw so many people on the mission, many members of the Church included, who chose to repent and turn to Christ. 

In my last area, my companion and I were teaching a younger couple who are members of the Church. The first few times we went by their house, they shared with us their struggles of staying active in the Church when other members of the ward had said some very unkind things about them and treated them in a not very Christlike way. However, as we helped them draw on the power of Jesus Christ and as they came to understand that their relationship with Him was more important than anything else, they began to experience a change of heart. They began to not only attend church and partake of the sacrament regularly but they began to participate actively in the Church and in their callings. This was another real yet unexpected experience where I felt that God had called me to be in a specific place to strengthen these specific people. Those whom I taught and who chose to repent always had a greater light in their lives and peace of conscience as they decided to turn their lives over to Him. 

As President Nelson also said, “If you feel you have strayed off the covenant path too far or too long and have no way to return, that simply is not true.” Elder K. Brent Nattress taught “we [are not lost] to the Lord. He stands at the door to lift us, to strengthen us, and to forgive us. His eternal message of hope is the healing balm for all who live in a troubled world. The Savior said, ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life.’” I promise that as you turn to God with full purpose of heart and invite others to do so, you will receive the Lord’s grace and mercy in your life. You will experience enduring joy. You will qualify to receive the most precious gift of eternal life. You will have the promise of living with your family in God’s presence for all eternity. 

I testify of the truthfulness of the words of Moroni in the Book of Mormon: “Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.”

In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
